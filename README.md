# Code Vault
A loose-leaf collection of undocumented code samples.

## About
This repository is meant to be an informal accumulation of various code samples that we have found to help out our developers
that would not fit in our [documentation site](https://platform.relativity.com).
Code samples are subject to change as the Relativity platform updates, and there is no official versioning of these code samples.
